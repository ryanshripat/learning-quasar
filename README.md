# learning-quasar
Here's me, trying my hand at front end development using several technologies I'm not familiar with.

## The main components here are 
1. An ASP.Net Core 7 Web API providing CRUD operations on a SQLite Database created using EF Core. (/Prueba folder) 
2. A Quasar SPA using the various CRUD operations provided by the API (/SPA/quasar-project/src/pages/UsersPage.vue is where the bulk of the work lives)

## Notes
I have no prior knowledge of Vue, Quasar and Front-end Component Architectures, and very little experience with TypeScript. This was a fun exercise. I've taken some pretty awful approaches to moving data around in Quasar because I haven't read up enough on it.
